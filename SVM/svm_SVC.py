## Support vector machines, using Sklearn
# This code trains a support vector machine model by desired parameters and kernel type, 
# and finally outputs a file containing the estimated wavelengths as well as truth-value 
# wavelengths of the test samples. The training data, test data and labels were initially 
# extracted in MATLAB, so we kept them the way they were. Trainng set and test set are 
# long matrices of 11 columns of transmittances values, one column per filter. The label 
# files are single column vectors containing the labels corresponding to each row of the 
# training/tests sets. The samples should be randomly shuffled before inputing to the code. 

# This code can either start training the model from scracth or use already 
# trained model, depending on whether the "Restore" value is set to False or True (shown below). 
# If Restore == True, the code will load from a saved model in './ckpt_svmT_files', else, it will 
# create the './ckpt_svmT_files' to save the parameter files. When the "fit" function has finished 
# its job the "predict" function evaluates the estimated wavelengths of test samples and writes 
# them in the file named 'Estimation_by_SVM_T_linear.xlsx'; it also outputs the elapsed time for 
# testing the entire test set.
# The user may change the file name ending: _linear if different kernel is employed.
